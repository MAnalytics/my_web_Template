# Welcome

Welcome to my website. The key purpose of this website is to provide a platform for a high-level description and discussion of my work, especially those ones with real life applications. I hope you find the contents useful. Enjoy!

# About me

I am a geo-informatician by training, specialising in crime and police data analytics. Based in MMU Crime and Well-Being Big Data Centre, my current research focus on the development of measures of crime inequalities and risk indicators, taking into account identified drivers and patterns of crime. Prior to joining the MMU, I have gained extensive experience working with the law enforcements in the areas of developing analytical tools for informing decision-making in a real-life operational environment. Some of my work have influenced police practices and helped to reduce crime levels in major cities of the UK. Check-out my GitHub page (https://github.com/geoMADE) for some useful crime analytical tools.
