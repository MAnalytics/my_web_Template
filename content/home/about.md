# MOnalytics

Welcome to my website - **MOnalytics**. This website is set to provide a high-level description of some of my research, especially those ones with further research and real practical applications. These are featured in the [Open-tools](https://www.madepeju.com/#projects) section of this website. I hope you find the contents useful. Enjoy!

# About me

I am a 'geoinformatician' - meaning that I attempt to make sense of things from a geographical point-of-view. Nearly all human phenomena have got certain spatial elements to them, and there is a lot we can learn by studying these elements. Of special interest to me is the spatial understanding of criminal behaviours and victimisation, and how we can leverage big data opportunities to answer key research questions. Based in [MMU Crime and Well-Being Big Data Centre](https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/crime-and-policing/big-data-centre/), my current research focus on the development of measures of crime inequalities and risk indicators, taking into account the identified drivers and spatial patterns of crime. Prior to joining the [MMU]((https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/crime-and-policing/big-data-centre/)), I have gained extensive experience in the areas of developing analytical tools for informing decision-making in a real-life policing environment. Some of my work have influenced police practices and helped to reduce crime levels in major cities of the UK. Check-out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/MAnalytics) for some useful crime analytical tools and [here](https://github.com/MAnalytics/Webdesign_using_Hugo_blogdown) for 'step-by-step' of how I design this website.
