# MOnalytics

Welcome to my website - **MOnalytics**. This website is set to provide a high-level description of some of my research, especially those ones with further research and real practical applications. These are featured in the **Open-tools** section of this website. I hope you find the contents useful. Enjoy!

# About me

I am a geo-informatician by training, specialising in big geo-data analytics, with a special application in the field of Criminology. Based in [MMU Crime and Well-Being Big Data Centre](https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/crime-and-policing/big-data-centre/), my current research focus on the development of measures of crime inequalities and risk indicators, taking into account the identified drivers and patterns of crime. Prior to joining the [MMU]((https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/crime-and-policing/big-data-centre/)), I have gained extensive experience in the areas of developing analytical tools for informing decision-making in a real-life policing environment. Some of my work have influenced police practices and helped to reduce crime levels in major cities of the UK. Check-out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/MAnalytics) for some useful crime analytical tools.
