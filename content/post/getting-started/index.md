# Abstract 

Since the 1990s, a dramatic decline in recorded crime has been observed across many developed polities (Aebi and Linde, 2010; Tseloni et al., 2010). Set against this finding, there has been limited attention paid the crime drop at the neighbourhood level, an exception being Bannister et al (2017) who found marked distinction in the crime drop trajectories of different neighbourhood groupings in Glasgow. Building upon this finding, this paper seeks to explore whether the crime drop has resulted in an increase in inequalities in the exposure to crime. The analysis utilises police recorded property and violent crime in Glasgow and Birmingham, enabling assessment of whether any observed shifting inequalities in the exposure to crime can be considered place specific or part of wider area trends.

This research deploys a novel 'inequity' kmeans clustering (iClustering) technique (Adepeju, Langton and Bannister, in preparation) to examine the longitudinal crime trajectories of neighbourhoods. This technique offers substantive advantage over existing longitudinal clustering techniques (Curman et al., 2015; Weisburd et al., 2004; Wheeler et al., 2015) enabling clearer delineation of neighbourhood crime trajectories. The results indicate growing inequalities in the exposure to crime and may be applied, in an era of fiscal austerity, to help target and prioritise policing interventions.


# Speaker

Dr Adepeju is a Senior Research Associate at the Manchester Metropolitan University Crime and Well-Being Big Data Centre. He obtained his PhD degree in GIS and Crime Science from University College London where he was able to develop a number of crime predictive methods, some of which are now being applied in a real policing environment. His research interest covers a wide range of spatial and quantitative techniques for crime and policing data analytics, census/neighbourhood analysis, transport and urban dynamics. Some of his recent research has focused on investigating the relationships between socioeconomic inequalities and crime risk distribution across the UK.
