# Introduction

Geographical processes such as crime, diseases, and pedestrian footfalls are extremely difficult to synthesise - they are inherently complex, and the theories for describing them are constantly evolving. 

Researchers often find themselves in a very precarious situation when carrying out real-life research projects, where data required to complete such projects are unavailable. Evidently, there are a number of legitimate reasons why such data might not be available, including confidentiality issues and the lack availability of usable data formats. 

To the credit of some computer/geospatial scientists, certain successes have been achieved in the areas of geographical modelling through computer simulation approach. However, many of these simulations are often too tailored towards a single problem and may not be extensible to other related problems. 

In this section, I introduce a *dynamic microsimulation framework* for simulating *crime patterns*. Crime patterns, arising from offenders behavioural patterns have both spatial and temporal signatures of different types. Thus, this framework is aimed at enabling different combinations of spatio-temporal crime patterns to be simulated.  

This framework was originally described [here](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/128602/1/monsuru_adepeju_gisruk2018.pdf).
