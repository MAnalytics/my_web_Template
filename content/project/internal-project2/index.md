# Introduction

Geogrpahical processes such as crime, diseases, and pedestrian footfalls are extremely difficult to synthesise or simulate - these phenomena are inherently complex, and theories that define them are still evolving. 

Researchers often find themselves in a very precarious situation when carrying out real-life research projects, where data required to complete such projects are unavailable. Of course, there are a number of legitimate reasons why such data might not be available, including confidentiality issues and lack availability of usable formats. 

To the credit of some computer/geographical scientists, some successes have been achieved in the area geographical modelling through computer simulation approach. However, many of these simulations are super-specific and might not be 'customisable' for other purposes. 

In this section, I introduce a dynamic microsimulation framework for simulating crime patterns. This framework is aimed to be adjustable for generating different kinds of dynamism in offenders behaviours, giving rise to all kinds of space-time crime patterns. 

The preliminary version of this framework was published [here](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/128602/1/monsuru_adepeju_gisruk2018.pdf).
