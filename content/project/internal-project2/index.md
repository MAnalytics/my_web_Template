# Introduction

Geographical processes such as crime, diseases, and pedestrian footfalls are extremely difficult to synthesise - these phenomena are inherently complex, and theories that define them are still evolving. 

Researchers often find themselves in a very precarious situation when carrying out real-life research projects, where data required to complete such projects are unavailable. Of course, there are a number of legitimate reasons why such data might not be available, including confidentiality issues and lack availability of usable formats. 

To the credit of some computer/geospatial scientists, some successes have been achieved in the area geographical modelling through computer simulation approach. However, many of these simulations are often too specific to a single scenario and might not be 'customisable' for other purposes. 

In this section, I introduce a *dynamic microsimulation framework* for simulating crime patterns. This framework is aimed to be 'customisable' for generating different types of dynamisms in offenders behaviours, giving rise to all kinds of crime distributions in space-time.

The preliminary version of this framework was published [here](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/128602/1/monsuru_adepeju_gisruk2018.pdf).
