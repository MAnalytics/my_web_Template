Here we present an approach which tries to understand some of the ways in which SES may go wrong, but constructing different complex simulation models and analysing the emergent outcomes. These, in silico, examples can allow for the institution of targeted data gathering instruments that give the earliest possible warning of deleterious outcomes, and thus allow for timely remedial responses. An example of this approach applied to fisheries is described.\nAuthor: Bruce Edmonds is Professor of Social Simulation and Director of the Centre for Policy Modelling (CfPM).

    "content": " Title: Hidden inequality in the exposure to crime? Unreported, reported and recorded crime in Greater Manchester 2012-2016\nAbstract: The level of recorded crime varies markedly across Greater Manchester, with deprived communities bearing a disproportionate burden. However, does recorded crime accurately capture inequality in the exposure to crime? Recorded crime is composed of reported incidents that are evidenced by the police to be a crime. If reporting and evidencing are consistent across communities and crime types, then recorded crime can be argued to be reflective of the lived reality. In other words, whilst some crimes remain hidden, their proportionate distribution falls in line with recorded crime. But, if reporting and evidencing varies across communities and by crime type, recorded crime can be argued to be unreflective of the lived reality, to mask hidden inequality in the exposure to crime.\nIn this paper we probe the existence of hidden inequality in the exposure to violent, property and nuisance crimes across communities in Greater Manchester, classified according to their level of deprivation, between 2012 and 2016. To do so, we utilise data from the Crime Survey of England and Wales, reported (incident) and recorded crime data, as well as census data. The research deploys a Bayesian hierarchical space-time model using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to examine the relationships between unreported, reported and recorded crime types across communities and through time. The results demonstrate the existence of marked hidden inequality in the exposure to crime, though this varies substantively by crime type. Finally, we discuss the implications of the findings for the advance of effective, efficient and legitimate policing interventions.\nAuthors: Dr Stephanie Wallace is a Lecturer in Criminology and Quantitative Methods at Manchester Metropolitan University, and an associate member of the Manchester Metropolitan Crime and Well-Being Big Data Centre. Stephanie obtained her PhD in Applied Social Statistics from Lancaster University, where her research focused on developing methods to measure sentence severity, and applying these methods to assess sentencing disparity in England and Wales. Her research continues to employ a range of quantitative techniques and methods to investigate disproportionality within the criminal justice system, particularly in relation to the spatial and temporal interplay with inequality.\nDr Karolina Krzemieniewska-Nandwani is a Research Associate at the Manchester Metropolitan University Crime and Well-Being Big Data Centre.

    "content": " Introduction This section describes a set of analytical tools for delineating a geographical space. A geographical space refers to a large geographical area, such as a town or a city, subdivided into a set of smaller administrative or non-administrative units. An example of an administrative unit is a district, neighbourhood, county or ward demarcation, while an example of a non-administrative unit is a system of regular grid or street network.\nIn spatial analysis, it is often required to modify an existing geographical delineation or create a new one, based on a given specification. The following subsection will talk about two tools, one for creating a new geographical delineation (demarcation), and the other for modifying an existing geographical delineation. The link to download the tools are also provided.\n1. Spatial grid generator: This tool creates a regular grid system over a geographical space. The tool requires a user to supply a spatial boundary of an area (in Esri format - .shp) and specify the grid size. The tool detects the spatial extent of the boundary and automatically create a system of regular grids, of the size specified, over the area. Below are examples regular grid systems of varying sizes, created by this tool, over the City of Chicago.\nInsert figs. here:\nPotential Applications:\nThe use of arbitrary grid system is common in crime analytics for some special reasons, which include confidentiality protection and as alternative in absence of a reasonably small adminstrative units. In particular, the grid systems have been used in hotspot policing in order to enable a more focussed targetting of problematic areas (Mohler et al. 2011).\nThis tool can be downloaded directly from here\n2. BDC_GeoConverter: This tool is developed to complement an online tool called Geoconverter (http://geoconvert.mimas.ac.uk/index.html). The Geoconverter is used for matching changed geographical units, or apportioning a dataset from an original geographical demarcation to a modified/changed geographical demarcation. For example, during 2011 UK census, it is observed that some census units, namely LSOAs and OAs, have been modified (either merged or split) when compared to their corresponding 2001 units. In Birmingham city for example, 10%* of 2011 LSOA units were affected. In a longitudinal analysis as an example, the aforementioned changes is problematic.\nIn an effort to address this issue, the online Geoconverter tool is created, in order to apportion any data from 2001 census demarcation to 2011 census demarcation, or vice versa. Alternatively, the tool can be used to generate a look-up table that provides the details those changes that have occured for the entire UK. For example, for any given 2001 unit code, the look-up table provides the corresponding (set of) 2011 unit codes and the share (ratio) of 2001 unit that each has got. The table will give \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; for any unit that remain the same in both years.\nThe look-up table is particularly useful for anyone who might wish to carry out the apportioning task programmatically.\nNow, the BDC_Geoconverter is created to deal with one key problem that is not addressed by the online Geoconverter. The online Geoconverter fails to capture some OAs that exist in 2001 and still exist in 2011, but have now been renamed (i.e. re-coded). This scenario is most common in Scotland area where high-rise buildings were demolished and re-built as smaller building units.\nPlease note that the work of BDC_Geoconverter still depends largely on the look-up table generated from the online Geoconverter.\nThis tool was originally developed for the Crime \u0026amp; Well_Being Big Data Centre and can be downloaded here.\n",

Grid-based \u0026amp; Street-based Crime Hotspot Predictors **Self-Exciting Point Process** **Prospective Space-time Scan Statistics** **Prospective Kernel Density Estiamtion Method** **Prospective Hotspotting**  2. Footfall Predictor This tool was developed as a part of the Surf Project funded by ESRC Future Research Leaders scheme. The tool, named as Leeds Footfall Predictor, built on the work led by Dr. Nick Malleson which determined that the daily footfall rates observed in the Leeds city centre can be explained in terms of external variables, such as temperature, rainfall and holidays. The research involved the application of different machine learning algorithms to a combination of these variables (predictors) and subsequently compared the accuracies of the former. It was established that the Random Forest algorithm by Breiman, 2001 is the most accurate for forecasting footfall rates. Thus, the algorithm, as implemented in R by Liaw and Wiener, 2002, was employed in the development of the Leeds Footfall Predictor. The tool was then deployed using the RShinydashboard platform.\nSome figures here (Developed by Monsuru Adepeju)\nFigure above shows the homepage of the tool.

    "summary": "Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.",
