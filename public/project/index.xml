      <description>Introduction This section describes a set of analytical tools for delineating a geographical space. A geographical space refers to a large geographical area, such as a town or a city, subdivided into a set of smaller administrative or non-administrative units. An example of an administrative unit is a district, neighbourhood, county or ward demarcation, while an example of a non-administrative unit is a system of regular grid or street network.</description>

      <description>Introduction This section introduces a set of predictive tools for certain geographical processes, such as crime and footfalls. The links to downloading these tools are also provided.
1. Grid-based &amp;amp; Street-based Crime Hotspot Predictors **Self-Exciting Point Process** **Prospective Space-time Scan Statistics** **Prospective Kernel Density Estiamtion Method** **Prospective Hotspotting**  2. Footfall Predictor This tool was developed as a part of the Surf Project funded by ESRC Future Research Leaders scheme.</description>
